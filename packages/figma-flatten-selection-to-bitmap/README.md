`asset` `bitmap` `export` `flatten` `image` `images` `resolution`

## Commands

### Flatten Selection to Bitmap

Rasterize the selected layers at a high resolution (`2x`, `3x`, `4x`, `8x`, or `10x`). (This is to work around a limitation in Figma where layers can only be rasterized at `1x` resolution.)

If layers in the selection contain strokes or effects that extend beyond the layersâ€™ bounding box, the position of the resulting image layer may be different from that of the original layers.

### Settings

Set the resolution at which layers are to be rasterized.
