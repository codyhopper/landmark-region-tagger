## Commands

### Delete Hidden Layers

Deletes all hidden layers within the selection or on the current page.

### Ungroup Single-Layer Groups

Ungroups single-layer groups within the selection or on the current page that have no background, blend mode, effect or export setting.

### Make Pixel-Perfect

Rounds the X and Y position and dimensions of layers within the selection or on the current page to the nearest pixel.

### Smart Rename Layers

Intelligently renames layers within the selection or on the current page.

- Layers of type Text will be named based on their text content.

- Layers with export settings will not be renamed.

Optionally specify a Regular Expression to skip the renaming of particular layers.

### Smart Sort Layers

Sort layers within the selection or on the current page by their X and Y position while maintaining their relative stacking order on the page.

### Clean Layers

Run all the above commands on layers within the selection or on the current page. Optionally skip processing of Locked layers.
